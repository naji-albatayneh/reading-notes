# Links in HTML

- **Links allow us to move from one webpage to another**

- **We can use the `<a href = "page path">Text to be clicked</a>` tag to add links**

- **In large websites, it is important to organize links**

- **We can use the property `Target = blank` to open links in new windows**

- **We can create links that refer to specific parts of the same page by using selectors, e.x., id selectors**

# layout in HTML using CSS

- **Types of elements based on the layout:**
- Block-level Elements
- Inline Elements

- **We can layout the page in more than one colomn using the CSS**


- **Containing element: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element using the `<div>` tag.**

- **We can design our website to fit in different sized screens:**
- Fixed width layout using fixed values
- Liqued width layout using percentage values
- Using grid layouts
- Using multiple CSS files
