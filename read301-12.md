# EJS Partials

- **EJS Partials are very useful for _large-scale websites_ to maintain their content in an easier way. This can be done by employing EJS Partials in order to define an HTML code in a saprete file under the `views/partials/` directory and `reuse` this file `partially in multiple different views` (i.e., pages) by including it into another HTML page whenever we need to, by using the following tag `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>` where the partial file is relative to the template we use it in. Accordingly, the  usage of the EJS partial tags `<%- %>` allow us to _inject and output the unescaped content onto the desired web page_. The dash (`-`) is important when using the `include() statement` in EJS partials to _ensure that EJS will not escape our HTML  tags and characters like opening and closing tags (`<` and `>`)_.**
