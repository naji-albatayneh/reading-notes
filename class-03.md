# Lists in HTML

- **There are three types of lists in html:**
- Ordered Lists: list items are in order and numbered
- Unordered Lists: list items are listed with bullet points
- Definition Lists: used to list terms along their definitions

**Ordered lists**

`<ol>`
`<li>first list item</li>`
`<li>second list item</li>`
`</ol>`

**Unordered lists**

`<ul\>
`<li>first list item</li>`
`<li>second list item</li>`
`</ul>`

**Definition lists**

`<dl>`
`<dt>first term</dt>`
`<dd>first term's definition</dd>`
`<dt>second term</dt>`
`<dd>second term's definition</dd>`
`</dl>`

- **We can use Nested Lists by adding a list within another list regardless the type**

# Boxes in HTML

- *Each _html_ element is treated by _css_ as it lives inside its own _box_, where each box has _width_ and _height_**

- **_width_ and _height_ can be limited for elements by setting the _min_ and _max_ of each properity**

- **If a content overflows (does not fet in its place), html provide us with an overflow properity to tell the browser what to do: whether to hide the content that overflow or to scroll to show the overflowed content**

`overflow: hidden;`
`overflow: scroll;`

- **Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance: Margin from the outside, Padding from the inside, and Border that lies between the margin and the Padding**

- **Border line can be styled in different appearences**

- **Padding allows us to control the space between and element and its Border**

- **Margin allows us to control the space between elements**

- **We can change the properity Display of html elements to be: Block, Inline, Inline-block, and None**

# Arrays in Javascript

- **Arrays can hold multiple values of the same data type**

- **Arrays starts from index zero, where each value in the array has its own index and can be accessed using this index**

# Switch Statement in Javascript

- **Switch statement can hold multiple conditions (cases) and multiple blocks of instructions that can be excuted only if the condition associated with them is evaluated to True**

### Truthy and Falsy values

- **Falsy values are treated as if they are fa 1 se. The table to the left shows a hi ghScore variable with a series of va lues, all of which are falsy. Falsy values can also be treated as the number 0**

- **Truthy values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true. Truthy va lues can also be treated as the number 1**
