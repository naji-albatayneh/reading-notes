**_Representational State Transfer (REST)_ is an architectural style software that employs the _Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)_, which is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems, in order to create `interactive applications that use Web Services`. As such, `REST is an alternative to SOAP` as a way to access a Web service, hence, any Web Service employs such communications guidelines is called `RESTful`. Thus, a Web service must provide its Web resources in a `textual representation` and allow them to be read and modified with a `stateless protocol and a predefined set of standard operations`. However, the systems that employ REST aim mainly for `performance communication, availability, reliability, and reusability`. `Ruby` on `Rails` are among popular RESTful web frameworks nowadays.**
