# Domain Modeling

- **Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.**

- **Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.**

- **Generate random numbers: To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a `Math.random()` function for just this sort of occasion.**

- **Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models:**

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# Tables in HTML

- **A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.**

- **The `<table>` element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.**

- **You indicate the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more `<td>` elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing `</tr>` tag.**

- **Each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>` element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing `</td>` tag.**

- **Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column. The colspan attribute can be used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.**

- **You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row. The rowspan attribute can be used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.**

- **The border attribute can be used on both the `<table>` and `<td>` elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.**

- **For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.**

# Objects in Javascript

- **We can create objects using a constructor notation.**

- **We can use DOT Notation or Square bracktes to update the properties and methods of an object**

- **We can use Delete keyword to delete a property for an object.**

- **We can create many objects using constructor notation.**

- **We can use `this.` keyword to access an object properties and methods internally.**

- **Arrays are special type of objects.**
