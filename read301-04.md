# CSS GRID

**We can use grids in CSS styling to layout the HTML elements of a webpage into a grid-like layout that has multiple rows and columns without the need to use position or float properties, hence providing an easier and responsive layout approach. In order to a have a grid layout in an HTML document, we need to set a Parent (i.e., grid container) which makes all direct Children of this grid container become grid items.**

- **Grid Container (parent):**
**The display property of a grid container can be set to either to grid which generates a block-level grid, or to inline-grid which generates an inline-level grid. We can specify the rows and the columns of the grid container using the following properties:**

- grid-template-columns

- grid-template-rows


```
Example:

.grid-container {
  grid-template-columns: 40px 50px auto 50px 40px;
  grid-template-rows: 25% 100px auto;
}
```

- **Grid Items (children):**

**When an element is defined as a gird item in CSS, it will not be affected by the following properties: float, display: inline-block, display: table-cell, and vertical-align. However, in order to determine the location (i.e., the position) of a gird item, we need to refer it to the following grid lines:**

- grid-column-start
- grid-column-end
- grid-row-start
- grid-row-end

```
Example:

.grid-item {
  grid-column-start: 2;
  grid-column-end: five;
  grid-row-start: row1-start;
  grid-row-end: 3;
}
```

- **Some of grid container's main properties:**
```
- display: To set an HTML element as a grid container.

- grid-template-columns: To define the columns of the grid container.

- grid-template-rows: To define the rows of the grid container.

- gap & grid-gap: To setup the row-gap & the column-gap.

- justify-items: To align the grid items in a row.
    
- align-items: To align the grid items in a column.

- grid-template: Can be used to setup the grid-template-rows and        grid-template-columns.

```

- **Note: In order to make a webpage design's responsive to multiple views, the values used need to be relative.**
