# Images in HTML

- **We might need to include images to a webpage for many purposes.**

- **We can use images in many formats and sizes to enhance user experience.**

- **We can use image tag to add images to a webpage as follows:**
`<img src="bath of the image" alt="Text to show if the image src is broken" title="title of the image" />`

- **We can use _width_ and _hieght_ properties to change the size of the image.**

- **Image element in HTML is an _Inline_ element.**

- **We can use _align_ property to align the image to the _left_, _right_, _top_, _middle_, _bottom_.**

- **It is important to have the image in the right _format_, _size_ amd _resolution_ before using it. We can use _Photoshop_ to do so.**

- **We can use `<figure>` and `figurecaption>` tags to add an image along its caption.**
