# The Call Stack and Debugging

## Call Stack

- **A _call stack_ is a _mechanism_ that allows us to _interpret_ the _way and the order_ a javascript block of code is _executed inside our machines_, which allow us to understand the flow of the running code and know the current context of executing, hence it will make easy the debuging and solving errors.**

- **More in details, once a function in javascrip is called (i.e., invoked), this function will be automatically added to the call stack. Then, the code will be executed in sequence and synchronously, however, any further call of any other functions inside the one that is already in the call stack, it will be added on the top of the call satck. The top of the call stack is meant to be executed first. Once a function on the top of the call stack is executed successfully, it will be automatically removed from the stack, then the next top function call in the stack will be executed and so on, until the stack is empty again which means that the whole block of code is executed successfully.**

- **A _stack overflow_ occurs (i.e., the browser throw a stack overflow error) when the call stack has exceeded a certain maximum limit that the is determined by a browser. Such stack overflow could occur due to a recursive function that keeps calling itself in an infinit loop.**

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

- **Types of error messages:**
- _Reference errors_ (e.g., when we use a variable that is not yet declared).
- _Syntax errors_ (e.g., syntax typos that cannot be parsed).
- _Range errors_ (e.g., giving a negative lenght to an arry will pose a range error).
- _Type errors_ (e.g., when assigning a number datatype value to a Boolian datatype variable).

- **Handeling Errors:**
- To avoid a system crash, we employ `try` to `catch` the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application.
- Eslint is a tool used to avoid runtime errors.
