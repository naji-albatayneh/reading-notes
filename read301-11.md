# Embedded JavaScript (EJS)

- **Embedded JavaScript (EJS) is a templating engine (i.e., language) that allows us to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript in a _simple_ way with a _minimal code_, without any specific restrictions about _organizing_, _laying out_ and _controlling flow_ the elements, hence it just employs a _plain JavaScript_.**

- **EJS can be used in both server-side (i.e., backend) and client-side (i.e., frontend), but it is recommended to use it for _server-side with node.js using Express module_ in order to _inject data_ into the HTML template at the client-side and produce the final HTML, and use Mustache templating for client-side using HTML module.**

- **We can pass data from the server-side by sending it to the EJS file, and then we can access it using this tag `<%= data %>`,and then the data will be embedded into an `h`, `p`, or another `text tag` to allow users to view it on the client-side.**

- **We can set EJS as a templating engine by using this line of code:**
**`app.set('view engine', 'ejs');`**

- **The _default behavior_ of EJS is that it looks into the `views folder` for the templates to render. Thus, we will need to make a `views folder` in _our main node project folder_ to keep our _EJS template files_ there in order to make them accessable by the EJS templating engine _upon requests_.**
