# Code Refactoring

- **Code refactoring is rewriting/rearranging a written code without changing its functionality and output in order to maintan and improve the design, structure, readability and implementation of a software system. In addition, refactoring aims to reduce both time and logic complexity, as well as to reduce memory allocation, this in turn will improve the overall software performance. Refactoring mainly targets object models, looping datatypes and data structures, and conditional statements.**


# Javascript Functional Programming

**Functional programming is a programming style aiming to build the structure and components of software systems by considering the flow of computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions and, therefore, avoids changing-state and mutable data to ansure the quality of software's outputs and functionality in different scenarios. Functional programming  compresis several concepts, such as:**

- **_Pure functions_ that assure returning accurat results, as the same results must be returned when the same values are passed as arguments.**

- **_Immutability_, which is assuring unchanging values and data over time.**

- **_Referential transparency_ which is the employment of pure functions with immutable data.**

- **_First-Class Functions_ are functions used and treated as values and data, it can be passed to other functions (i.e., _Higher-order Functions_) as parameters, and returned as results from other functions (i.e., _Higher-order Functions_).**
