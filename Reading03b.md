# HTML5, new elements and exceptions to be handled

**The new elements introduced in HTML5 indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. They are called Semantic Elements and they provide clearer code to the developer and to the browser, compared with using multiple `<div>` elements. However, as HTML5 is inroduced with many new features, old browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements in order to get the web page presented in any browser. For instance, to make new elements offered by HTML5  well in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available by Google as opensourced.**



# How to build a good website

**First of all, it's important to understand who the target audience is, why they would come to the website, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return. Then, we need to plan the structure of the web pages in the website by making Wireframes that allow us to organize the information that will be presented on each webpage. However, site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site easily. We need to keep in mind that design is about communication, in which, visual hierarchy of the content helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them in the website. In the wireframe, we can use several sizes, colors, and styles to differentiate between objects pieces of information. In addition, we need to use grouping and similarity to present objects on the webpage to help simplify
the information it presents.**
