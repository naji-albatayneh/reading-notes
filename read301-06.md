**We can use `Node.js` as a _backend cross-platform environment_ to execute JavaScript `asynchronously` in runtime `outside the web browser`, whether on `local machines` (client side) or on `servers`. Node.js employs an open-source JavaScript engine (i.e.,  Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine) that supports ES6 and, is `compatible` for different browsers. In order to use Node.js, we need to use `npm` which is the world’s largest software registry that can allow us to install packages `locally` and `globally` to our JavaScript app projects, hence npm is used for installing while Node.js is used for running. However, this makes Node.js a suitable platform for building apps that require `server-client real-time data exchange and interaction` since it is a `single-threaded` and an `event-driven paradigm` that employs `libuv` library in order to offer such `asynchronous non-blocking behavior`, which comes with its `expense` in terms of CPU-intensive operations in the single-worker thread.**
