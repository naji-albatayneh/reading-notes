# Styling Images in HTML

- **Controlling the size and alignment of images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of the page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.**

- **We can use the `hieght` and `width` properties to control the presentation of images in HTML using CSS**

- **In terms of `response time`, specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.**

- **We can use the `float` properety to float images left or right within their parent container.**

- **We can align images in the `center` of the page by setting their `display properety to block`, and then to set the `left and right margins` to `auto`.**

- **The `background-image` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.**

- **The background-repeat property can have four values:**

- **`repeat`: The background image is repeated both `horizontally` and `vertically` (the default way it is shown if the background repeat property isn't used).**

- `repeat-x`: The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
- `repeat-y`: The image is repeated vertically only.
- `no-repeat`: The image is only shown once.

- **The `background-attachment` property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:**

- `fixed`: The background image stays in the same position on the page.
- `scroll`: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

- **can use the `background-position` property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. Positions can be:**

- left top
- left center
- left bottom
- center top
- center center
- center bottom
- right top
- right center
- right bottom

- **The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.**

1. `background-color`
1. `background-image`
1. `background-repeat`
1. `background-attachment`
1. `background-position`

- **When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a `sprite`. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image. The `advantage` of using sprites is that the web `browser only needs to request one image` rather than many images, which can make the `web page load faster`.**

- **We can use `gradient backgrounds` in CSS, and we can change the contrast of background images if we want to show a text over them. Contrast can be `low`, `high` or `screen`.**

# Putting the site on the web, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Useful Analitics about visitors


- **SEO helps making a site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.**

- **`On-page` techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines, by using `keywords` that users mostly look for.**

- **`Off-page` techniques is getting `other sites to link` to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to `rank your site` by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.**

- **Search engines also look at the `words between` the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered more `relevant`. The words that appear in links to your site should also appear in the text of the page that the site links to.**

- **One of the best tools for doing site analytics is offered by `Google` called `Google Analytics`.**

- **To but your site on the web, you need to transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as `File Transfer Protocol (FTP)`.**
