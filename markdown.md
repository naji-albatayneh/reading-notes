### What is Markdown?
**Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like \# or \*.**

The following are some samples showing how to style some features using Markdown:

**1. Headers in Markdown:**

Syntax in Markdown | Crossponding style in HTML
------------ | -------------
\# text | This is an \<h1\> tag
\#\# text | This is an \<h2\> tag
\#\#\#\#\#\# text | This is an \<h6\> tag

**2. Emphasis in Markdown:**

Syntax in Markdown | 
------------ | 
\**This text will be italic*\* |
\__This will also be italic_\_ |
\*\***This text will be bold**\*\* |
\_\___This will also be bold__\_\_ |
\__You **\*\*can\*\*** combine them\__ |


**3. Unordered Lists in Markdown:**

Syntax in Markdown | 
------------ | 
\* Item 1 |
\* Item 2 |
  \* Item 2a |
  \* Item 2b |
