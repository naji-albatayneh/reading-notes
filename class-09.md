# Forms in HTML

- **We can use several types of form controls to collect information from visitors to the site.**

- **We can add text `(e.g., normal text multiline or inline, and passwords)`, or make a choice `(e.g., radio button, check box or drop list)` or submit a form `(e.g., submit or image buttons, or file upload)`**

- **A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server, then the name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects. After that the server process it.**

- **Information from a form is sent in `name/value pairs`.**

- **`<form>`: Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a `method` and `id` attribute too.**

- **`action`: Every `<form>` element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.**

- **We can use `method` which can be sent using one of two methods, get or post.**

- **We can use `id attribute` to pass a value that is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page.**

- **The `<input>` element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.**

- **When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it. However, each form control should have its own `<label>` element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users. The `<label>` element can be used in two ways:**

- Wrap around both the text description and the form input.
- Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for.

- **We can group related form controls together inside the `<fieldset>` element. This is particularly helpful for longer forms.**

- **We can use validation to the data input in the form element.**


# Lists and Tables in HTML

- **We can use unordered lists `<ul>`, or ordered lists `<ol>` to arrange data in our page.**

- **We can also use tables to present data on a page.**


# Events in JS

- **When we browse the web, our browser registers different types of events:**
- UI events
- Keyboard events
- Mouse events

- **We can triger a script when we click the events.** 

- **Event handlers let you indicate which event you are waiting for on any particular element. There are three types of event handlers:**
- HTML event handlers
- Traditional DOM event handlers
- DOM level2 event listeners
