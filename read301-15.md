# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

- **Most tech companies and startups' CEOs seek and appreciate both diversity and inclusion in their teams and employees, as such factors bring back many benefits and outcomes to the company itself and, hence to the industry. Diversity and inclusion come in different sorts such as, the gender, language, ethnicity, age, experience and background, etc. However, although the backbone of tech industry is mostly based on the contributions of male employee noewadays, female have also their significant contributions and effects. As seen in different firms, female leaders could be more successful in leading tech towards prosperity and success. Keeping this in mind, knowledge and innovation are not reserved for a specific gender neither for a specific ethnicity or age! Therefore, teams and companies should take this in consideration when building their successful teams.**
