# MarkDown using GitHub

#### 1. Introduction to Markdown and Github
Here you can learn what is [**Markdown (MD)**](https://naji-albatayneh.github.io/reading-notes/markdown) and [**GitHub**](https://naji-albatayneh.github.io/reading-notes/github) and how to use MD to style all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

##### Markdown
*Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.*


##### Github
*GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. However, after you get your profile set up, you can create a new repository and initialize a default README.md file to start styling using Markdown. Do not forget to commit your changes every time you edit your file in order to control your files version. Then, after you get your file done, you need to deploy your webpage by following the instruction sfrom the setting tab. You can choose a theme to your webpage to make it look nicer.*
