# INRODUCING CSS

**- CSS tells the web browser how the content should look like to the user**

**- CSS can be used in three ways: 
- Inline: as an attribute within an HTML element
- Internally: within an HTML document in the \<head\> tag
- Externally: in a seperate file (THE BEST PRACTICE because we can use the same style to other pages without rewriting the CSS code)

**- We  can use different selectors to select elements in CSS to add styling to them**

**- Box model: each element is surrounded by a virtual box of some features control how the element should appear to the user**
