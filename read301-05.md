# MarkDown using GitHub

# Heroku Deployment

## This read is providing practical instructions on `HOW` to setup and use  Heroku for deploying our apps, rather than providing `WHAT` and `WHY` is Heroku. As such this read will take few days to be summarized until i research, read and use and employ many external resources about this topic. Submission of this complete read is going to be later on weekend in order to enssure the quality of the information being read and written.
