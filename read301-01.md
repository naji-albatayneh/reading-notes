## Responsive Web Design

- **Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.**

- **Currently the most popular technique lies within responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way. This solution has the benefits of being all three, responsive, adaptive, and mobile.**

- **Flexible Layouts**

- Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including `flexible layouts`, `media queries`, and `flexible media`.
