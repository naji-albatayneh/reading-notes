# Sending form data (Update/Delete)

- **We can use `<form>` HTML elements in the client-side to define the _Action_ and the _Method_ used to send the validated data (i.e., request) to the server-side. However, on the one side, the _Action_ attribute is used to specify the _location_ the data is going to be sent to the server whether to a valid `Relative` or `Absolute` URL. In case that the _Action_ of the form is not specified, the data will be sent to the _same URL_ of the webpage that contains the form (i.e., current page). On the other side, the form's _Method_ attribute is used to specify the _way_ the form data is going to be _transmitted_ to the server-side. However, this can be done by using the `GET` or the `POST` methods. When using a `GET` method, a request with an `empty body` will be sent to the server and the form _data is appended to the URL_ as a series of `name/value pairs` (i.e., at the end of the URL, we include a `?` followed by `name/value` pairs separated by `&`), hence, this method is `not recommended` to be used to `send secrect data` (e.g., passwords). In the conterary, `POST` method is `recommended` to be used when sending a `large amount of data` and/or `secret data` to the server, as the data is `appended to the body` of the HTTP request and the URL will have no data to be shown to the end-user.**
