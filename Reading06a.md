# Introducing CSS

- **_CSS_ is used with _HTML_ in order to specify how the content of an element should appear to the user.**

- **_CSS_ can be used in three ways:**
1. **_Inline_ within HTML tags**
1. **_Internally_ using _style_ tag within HTML file**
1. **_Externally_ in a saprate .css file**

- **We use different types of selectors to allow targeting our rules at different elements.**

- **Box Model: each element is surrounded by padding, border and margin, each of which has its funcunallity in styling an element**


# Colors in CSS

- **RGB values: these express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)**

- **HEX codes: these are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80**

- **We also can use colors names directly by choosing the color name if it is exist**

- **Opacity property in RGB: allows us to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).**


- **HSL**
**Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.**

**Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.**

**Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.**

- **HSLA**
**A stands for Alpha: this is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.**
