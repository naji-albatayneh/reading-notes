# Structured Query Language (SQL)

- **Structured Query Language (SQL) is a simple standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in relational databases by using queries.**

- **A _relational database_ is a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables, associated with each other using a `primary key` data in one table which must be `unique`, and a `foreign key` data in another table.**

- **A _table_ is a collection of related data entries and it consists of multiple columns and rows.**

- **A _query_ is a statement that declares and specifies the data we are looking for in our database. It also specifies where to find the data in the database, and how to transform it before it is returned if needed.**

- **If a field has a `NULL value`, then it is with no value and that means it is optional field.**

- **If we need to use the same query multiple times, we can save it in a _stored procedure_, so the code can be reused over and over again each time we call it. We also can also pass _parameters_ to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the passed parameter value.**

- **Frequently used SQL Commands:**

- `SELECT` - to select and extract data from a database
- `UPDATE` - to update data in a database
- `DELETE` - to delete data from a database
- `INSERT INTO` - to insert new data into a database
- `CREATE DATABASE` - to create a new database
- `ALTER DATABASE` - to modify a database
- `CREATE TABLE` - to create a new table
- `ALTER TABLE` - to modify a table in the database
- `DROP TABLE` - to delete a table from a database
- `CREATE INDEX` - to create an index (can be used as a search key)
- `DROP INDEX` - to delete an index
