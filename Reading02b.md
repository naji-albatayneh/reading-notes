# What is Git?
In order to explain what is Git, we first need to understand what Version Control is. Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.
There are three types of version control:
- Local Version Control
- Centralized Version Control 
- Distributed Version Control

*Git is a Distributed Version Control System that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.*
*Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.*
*Git has a GUI and also can be used threough a Terminal by executing commands.*
