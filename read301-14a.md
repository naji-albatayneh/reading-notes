# Database Normalization

- **We can _normalize a database_ by applying some rules on it in order to organize its tables and columns and, hence, the data included in it. This can be achieved by _limiting tables to have only entries about single specific topic or purpose_ for each. However, this would make the data more organized, _reduce the redanduncy_ level of the database entries, and _ease the search and reachiness_ to the desired data by _simplifying the SQL queries_ that can be used to select specific data and topics, as well as improve the overall _performance and maintenance_ of the database.**
