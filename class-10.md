# Error Handling and Debugging in Javascript

- **Order of excuting the code matters as some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run.**

- **`Excution context` and the `Scope `of variables can be `Global` or `Function-Level-Scope`**

- **Javascript is run in a stack way.**

- **Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:**
- Prepare
- Execute

- **If a JavaScript statement generates an `error`, then it throws an `exception`. At that point, the interpreter `stops` and looks for `exception-handling` code.**

- **Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them.**

- **Types of errors:**
- Syntax Error
- Reference Error
- Eval Error
- URI Error
- Type Error
- Range Error

- **When there are errors, we can:**
- Debug the script to fix errors
- Handle the errors using `try`, `catch`, `throw`, and `finally` statements

- **We can use the `console` from the browser to hunt errors using the `console.log()`**

- **You can pause the execution of a script on any line using `breakpoints`. Then you can check the values stored in variables at that point in time.**

- **You can indicate that a `breakpoint` should be triggered only if a `condition` that you specify is met. The condition can use existing variables.**
