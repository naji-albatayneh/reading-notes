# Flexbox and Templating

## Javascript Templating using Mustache

- **We can use JSON data sources to create our own HTML markup templates in javascript, allowing us to efficiently render cairten client-side view. This custom template is made at runtime where the template engine replaces the variables and objects used inside the template to values that can be converted later to an HTML file that can be sent to the client to use it.**

- **Mustache is a syntax that is used in HTML for logic-less client side rendering templates. It also can be used with config files, source code, etc.**

- **By employing Mustache, we expand tags in a template using values provided by a client in a form of # or object.**

- **`If statements`, `else clauses`, and `for loops` are `not allowed` in Mustache templating syntax.**

- **Mustache support several languages.**

- **Mustache uses `{{}} as place holders` for replacing values**

## CSS flexbox layout

- **`Flex Boxes` can be used to provide the programmer with a more efficient way to structure, layout, align and manage the spaces between items in an HTML container, especially when the size of elements is unknown or dynamic.**

- **Flex Boxs can be used to `prevent overflow` in HTML containers.**

- **It is recommended to use `Flex Box` to `small-scale` layouts of components, while the `Grid` layout is recommended to be used to `larger scale` component layouts.**
