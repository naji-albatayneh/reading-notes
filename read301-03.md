# Flexbox and Templating

## Javascript Templating using Mustache

- **We can use JSON data sources to create our own HTML markup templates in javascript, allowing us to efficiently render cairten client-side view. This custom template is made at runtime where the template engine replaces the variables and objects used inside the template to values that can be converted later to an HTML file that can be sent to the client to use it.**

- **Mustache is a syntax that is used in HTML for logic-less client side rendering templates. It also can be used with config files, source code, etc.**

- **By employing Mustache, we expand tags in a template using values provided by a client in a form of # or object.**

- **`If statements`, `else clauses`, and `for loops` are `not allowed` in Mustache templating syntax.**

- **Mustache support several languages.**

- **Mustache uses `{{}} as place holders` for replacing values**

## CSS flexbox layout

- **`Flex Boxes` can be used to provide the programmer with a more efficient way to structure, layout, align and manage the spaces between items in an HTML container, especially when the size of elements is unknown or dynamic.**

- **Flex Boxs can be used to `prevent overflow` in HTML containers.**

- **It is recommended to use `Flex Box` to `small-scale` layouts of components, while the `Grid` layout is recommended to be used to `larger scale` component layouts.**

# Pair Programming

## Why Pair Programming?

- **Getting the work done using two pearsons is better than one, where there are two heads that think about different thoughts and different experiences. Time is also devided by two.**

- **Also, one person might be good at software design and engineering while the other might be better at coding.**

- **Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.**

## What is Pair Programming?

- **Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.**

- **The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.** 

- **The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.**

- **Greater efficiency can be attaned**

- **Better engagment and collaboration between pairs, which enhance the quality of outputs and enhance the learning flow.**

- **Improving scializing and communication skills.**
