# STRUCTURE WEBPAGES IN HTML

**- Webpages are built and structured using HTML**

**- HTML uses tags to structure the webpage and to present its content in a certain way**

**- We can check the structure of any webpage on the Internet by going to the View menu in the browser, and select the option that says Source or View source**

**- HTML uses tags _characters that sit inside angled brackets_ to give the content between them a special meaning and a certain view**

**- Tags are called also elements**

**- We have opening tags denotes the start of a piece of content and closing tags denotes the end**

**- Opening tags may have attributes, which provide more details about the contentthe tag contains**

**- Each attribute in HTML requires a name and an assigned value**

# EXTRA MARKUP IN HTML

**- HTML has different versions. However, the last one and the one we use is HTML5**

**- HTML5 documents are decleared using this tag \<!DOCTYPE html\>**

**- \<!\-\- This is how comments are in HTML \-\-\>**

**- HTML tags can have unique id attributes used to refer to the tags**

**- HTML tags can have class attributes used to refer to the tags. More than tag can have the same class**

**- There are Block elements and Inline elements. The former takes the whole block width viewsuch as, \<h1\>, \<p\>, \<ul\>, and \<li\>, while the later appear inline with other elements such as, \<a\>, \<b\>, \<em\>, and \<img\>**

**- We can use \<div\> tag to group text and elements in one block**

**- We can use \<span\> tag to group text and elements inline**

**- We can use \<iframe\> tag to view another HTML page inside a frame in an HTML page**

**- Escape characters are used to include special characters in webpages such as \< and \>**

# NEW HTML5 LAYOUT ELEMENTS

**- A well-structured HTML5 document should have the following tags in the following structure:**
\<!DOCTYPE html\>
\<html\>
    \<head\>
        \<title\>\</title\>
    \</head\>
    \<body\>
        \<header\>
            \<h1\>\</h1\>
            \<nav\>
                \<ul\>
                    \<li\>\</li\>
                \</ul\>
            \</nav\>
        \</header\>
        \<main\>\</main\>
        \<footer\>\</footer\>
    \</body\>
\</html\>
