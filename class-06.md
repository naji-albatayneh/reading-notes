# Objects in Javascript

- **Objects group a set of variables and and functions to make a model the have all the variables as propreties and functions as methods.**

`var object-name {propereties and methods};`

- **We can create an object using literal notation**

- **We can access the propereties and the methods of an object using the _dot notation_ or we can access the propereties by using `[]`**

`object.name;` or `object['name'];`

# The Document Object Model (DOM)

- **The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.**

- **As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browser's memory. It consists of four main types of nodes:**
- Document Nodes
- Element Nodes
- Attributes Nodes
- Text nodes

- **Each node is an object with methods and properties. Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file). Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser.**

- **There are multiple ways to select nodes**


- **It is recommended to store a node in a variable if we use it more than once.**

- **When accessing nodes, DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.**

- **We can loop through a nodelist to access values**
