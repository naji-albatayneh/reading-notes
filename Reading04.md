# JavaScript (Js), What is Js and why we use it?

- **Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, as it enables interactive web pages which is an essential part of modern and interactive web applications. Javascript allow us to reload only a portion of the webpage instead of loading the whole page which is time consuming. The vast majority of websites and web applications use javascript for client-side page behavior and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.**

- **What is a Script? A script is a series of instructions a computer (e.g., the browser) can understand and follow to make actions in order to achieve a goal a user desires.**

- **In order to code a good script, you first need to understand the problem you need to solve using the script. Then, you need to break down the goal you want to achieve into a series of sub-goals. You might need to organize your work using a flowchart. However, then you can start coding your script for achieving each sub-goal you sat until you solve the whole problem.**

## Expressions in Js

- **An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Types of expressions:**
- *Expressions that assign a value to a variable*
- *Expressions that use multiple values to return a single value.*

- **Expressions rely on operators, which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.**

- **Types of operators:**
- *Arithmetic operators*
- *Logical operators*
